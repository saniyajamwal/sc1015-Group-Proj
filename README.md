## About

This is Team 1's mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) with a primary focus on the crime rates in the state of Washington DC.

## Question/Problem Definition 
Crime occurs in every country and poverty is something no country is exempt from. This got us thinking on the correlation between the two and how one impacts the other. This in itself made us question:

> *To what extent, if any, are the effects of income distribution on the frequency of crimes against property?*

## Dataset Selection & Preparation
After extensive online research, our team finalised on a dataset we found to be suitable for our project. We decided to take the crime rate statistics from the United States of America and specifically the state of Wahington DC as this allowed us to work with a larger data set.
