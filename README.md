# About

This is Team 1's mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) with a primary focus on the crime rates in the state of Washington DC.

## Question/Problem Definition 
Crime occurs in every country and poverty is something no country is exempt from. This got us thinking on the correlation between the two and how one impacts the other. This in itself made us question:

> *To what extent, if any, are the effects of income distribution on the frequency of crimes against property?*

# Dataset Selection & Preparation
After extensive online research, our team finalised on a dataset we found to be suitable for our project. We decided to take the crime rate statistics from the United States of America and specifically the state of Wahington DC as this allowed us to work with a larger data set from [OpenDataDC](https://opendata.dc.gov/search?collection=Dataset).

However, the data sets on OpenDataDC are quite extensive and seperated so our team had to complie all the necessary data into [dc_crime_add_vars.csv.zip](https://github.com/saniyajamwal/sc1015-Group-Proj/blob/main/dc_crime_add_vars.csv.zip). Furthermore, we honed in further on the data so as to make our problem definition more focused and this was done by analyizing the data from [CRIME_EXTRA.csv](https://github.com/saniyajamwal/sc1015-Group-Proj/blob/main/CRIME_EXTRA.csv).

# Exploratory Data Analysis
For our Exploratory Data Analysis we collaborated in a jupyter notebook titled [project final.ipynb](https://github.com/saniyajamwal/sc1015-Group-Proj/blob/main/project%20final.ipynb) and these are our findings:

## Income Distribution 
When looking at the data, the offensors were categorised by race and income and we decided to choose the later as the cause of motivation for commiting the crime. This hence made income distribution the focus for our project.
